# PHP Legal Licenses

Legal Licenses is a utility to help generate a single text file containing all of the important information about a project's dependencies. In some organizations, the use of Open Source Software (OSS) is strictly controlled and audited, and requires having every OSS library simply documented.

This utility will generate a `licenses.md` file in the root of your project that contains a list of all dependencies, the currently installed version, commit sha, its description, homepage, list of licenses, and full license text if it is present in the dependency source code directly. It receives this information from the `composer.lock` file, so you must have run a `composer update` or `composer install` at least once in order to use this utility.

## Installation

If you need a utility such as this for your place of business, chances are, you will need it for more than a single project. Therefore, the easiest and reccommeded way to install this utility is as a global composer package:

```php
composer global require comcast/php-legal-licenses
```

## Usage

If you installed php-legal-licenses globally via composer, you should be able to run the script in any of your projects. Note, you must have run either `composer update` or `composer install` at least once, to create a `composer.lock` file.

```
$ cd /path/to/my/project
$ which php-legal-licenses
> ~/.composer/vendor/bin/php-legal-licenses
$ php-legal-licenses generate
> Generating Licenses file...
> Done!
```

You can also hide dependency version with `--hide-version` option:

```
$ php-legal-licenses generate --hide-version
```



## Example Output
Here is a snippet of the licenses file that would be generated for this utility itself:

```
# Project Licenses
